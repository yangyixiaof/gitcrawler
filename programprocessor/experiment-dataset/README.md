# Important Notice

Actually, when we conduct experiment, we only compare with 3-gram. 
The 3-gram uses little context information so our model is better than 3-gram model in statement level completion. 
To ease the prediction of 3-gram, we have changed the names of variables in test files to match the names of variables in training files. 
However, on GitHub, there exists similar files which have very strange name conventions. 

Thus, we change the test data sets to the original 'hard version' which contains noisy unseen words. 
Actually in this hard version, the 6-gram performs similar to 3-gram as the unseen word will decrease the performance of the model sharply. 
In the meanwhile, our model can deal with the unseen word and predict the unseen word correctly. 
Please use the newest version for comparison.
